# Pipex
Replicate shell's pipe functionality (cmd1 | cmd2). <br>
I've heard people said that whilst Pipex gives you a good base to connect Minishell afterwards, Minitalk does fuck all. <br>
Therefore, it's recommended to choose Pipex over Minitalk, which on the other hand could be useful for the parsing part in Minishell, they said.
