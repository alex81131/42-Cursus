### Private, Protected, Public
1. Public members are available for any scope.
2. Private members are only available for current class objects.
3. Protected members are availabe for all derived objects.

### Virtual
1. The virtual keyword allows pointers or values to be overridden in derived classes.
2. It's a good practice to declare the destructor as virtual to ensure that all derived objects are properly destroyed.
