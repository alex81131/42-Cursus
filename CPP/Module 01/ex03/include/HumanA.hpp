// Use referernce: const std::string&, to avoid duplication and hence more efficient.

// The reference (const Weapon&) indicates that HumanA does not own the Weapon object; it merely refers to an existing Weapon object. This means that HumanA expects the Weapon to outlive it, and it won't manage the memory of the Weapon.
// Since itâ€™s a reference, HumanA is bound to a specific Weapon for its entire lifetime.
